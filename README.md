# SlideDM

#### In a highly digital economy, an extreme percentage of new interactions taken by young people are initiated with technology. SlideDM is a revolutionary new chat application that allows users to connect with friends based on their geolocation and social connections. Using this technique, our application encourages rekindling connections with friends from your past and promotes new connections with similar interests.

## Run Steps:
When the application launches, select either Continue with Contacts or Continue with Facebook. Make sure to allow the app to track your location. On the next screen, enter your first and last name. In the phone number input label, enter a phone number without grammatical characters. For example: 14085551020.

Once your profile is set up, you will move to a page where you can view nearby users. Then, select a user to start a conversation and send them a inviting message. All data is stored in Firebase.


## Setup Steps:
Make sure to have Pods downloaded for your xcode project:
```
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
```
