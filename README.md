## Run Steps:
When the application launches, select either Continue with Contacts or Continue with Facebook. Make sure to allow the app to track your location. On the next screen, enter your first and last name. In the phone number input label, enter a phone number without grammatical characters. For example: 14085551020.

Once your profile is set up, you will move to a page where you can view nearby users. In the future, only users that also appear in your contacts will be shown. Select a user to start a conversation and send them a message. These messages are stored in Firebase under a conversation collection. 


## Setup Steps:
Make sure to have Pods downloaded for your xcode project:
```
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
```
